# 🚁 SkyRanger - The AI-Ready Quadcopter 🚀  

### 🛠️ Built with Love, Tech & A Bit of Hope for Sponsorship 😆  

Welcome to **SkyRanger**, my final year drone project! This quadcopter is built using **APM 2.8 / Pixhawk PX4**, packed with high-precision sensors, and is ready for action. In the future, I plan to **integrate Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano for AI-powered object tracking and autonomous navigation**. If you're an awesome sponsor looking to support a tech enthusiast—well, **here’s your chance to make the future fly!** 😎

## 🏗️ Project Overview  

**SkyRanger** is a **Q450 Quadcopter** designed for stable flight, remote-controlled operations, and future AI integrations. This drone is capable of GPS-assisted navigation and can be used for aerial photography, surveillance, and experimental AI-driven flight operations.

## 🔩 Hardware Components  

| Component | Model/Specs |
|-----------|------------|
| **Frame** | Q450 Quadcopter Frame – PCB Version |
| **Motors** | EMAX MT2213 935KV BLDC (CW & CCW) |
| **ESCs** | Emax BLHeli Series 30A with Oneshot |
| **Flight Controller** | Pixhawk PX4 Autopilot PIX 2.4.8 / APM 2.8 |
| **GPS Module** | Ublox NEO-M8N |
| **Transmitter** | Flysky FS-i6X 2.4GHz 10CH |
| **Battery** | Orange 5200mAh 3S 40C/80C LiPo |
| **Other Accessories** | XT60 Connectors, Lipo Voltage Checker, Servo Leads |

## 🧠 How It Works  

1. **Manual Flight Mode** - Controlled via the FlySky FS-i6X transmitter.  
2. **GPS-Assisted Flight** - The Pixhawk/APM uses GPS to stabilize and maintain altitude.  
3. **Failsafe Mode** - If the connection is lost, the drone can return to home (RTH).  
4. **AI Upgrade (Coming Soon...)** - Planning to integrate **Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano** for AI-based object tracking, autonomous flight, and real-time decision-making.
