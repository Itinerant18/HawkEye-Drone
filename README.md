## Setup Instructions
1. **Assemble the Frame**: Attach the arms, motors, and propellers.
2. **Install Flight Controller**: Connect the APM 2.8 to the drone frame.
3. **Power Supply**: Connect the LiPo battery and check voltage levels.
4. **AI Setup**:
   - Install **Jetson Nano/Raspberry Pi**
   - Set up **OpenCV & TensorFlow** for object tracking
5. **Flight Testing**:
   - Calibrate the **gyroscope & accelerometer**
   - Run initial test flights in **stabilize mode**
6. **Autonomous Mode**:
   - Configure **GPS waypoints** in **Mission Planner**
   - Enable **object tracking** with AI model

## 🧠 How It Works  

1. **Manual Flight Mode** - Controlled via the FlySky FS-i6X transmitter.  
2. **GPS-Assisted Flight** - The Pixhawk/APM uses GPS to stabilize and maintain altitude.  
3. **Failsafe Mode** - If the connection is lost, the drone can return to home (RTH).  
4. **AI Upgrade (Coming Soon...)** - Planning to integrate **Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano** for AI-based object tracking, autonomous flight, and real-time decision-making.

## 🎯 Features & Future Plans  

✅ Stable Flight with GPS Assistance  
✅ Remote-Controlled Navigation  
✅ AI Object Tracking (Future)  
✅ Autonomous Flight Missions (Future)
