# 🚁 SkyRanger - The AI-Ready Quadcopter 🚀  

### 🛠️ Built with Love, Tech & A Bit of Hope for Sponsorship 😆  

Welcome to **SkyRanger**, my final year drone project! This quadcopter is built using **APM 2.8 / Pixhawk PX4**, packed with high-precision sensors, and is ready for action. In the future, I plan to **integrate Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano for AI-powered object tracking and autonomous navigation**. If you're an awesome sponsor looking to support a tech enthusiast—well, **here’s your chance to make the future fly!** 😎

## Setup Instructions
1. **Assemble the Frame**: Attach the arms, motors, and propellers.
2. **Install Flight Controller**: Connect the APM 2.8 to the drone frame.
3. **Power Supply**: Connect the LiPo battery and check voltage levels.
4. **AI Setup**:
   - Install **Jetson Nano/Raspberry Pi**
   - Set up **OpenCV & TensorFlow** for object tracking
5. **Flight Testing**:
   - Calibrate the **gyroscope & accelerometer**
   - Run initial test flights in **stabilize mode**
6. **Autonomous Mode**:
   - Configure **GPS waypoints** in **Mission Planner**
   - Enable **object tracking** with AI model

## 🧠 How It Works  

1. **Manual Flight Mode** - Controlled via the FlySky FS-i6X transmitter.  
2. **GPS-Assisted Flight** - The Pixhawk/APM uses GPS to stabilize and maintain altitude.  
3. **Failsafe Mode** - If the connection is lost, the drone can return to home (RTH).  
4. **AI Upgrade (Coming Soon...)** - Planning to integrate **Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano** for AI-based object tracking, autonomous flight, and real-time decision-making.
